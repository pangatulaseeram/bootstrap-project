  <div class="container">
       Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya (15 September 1861 – 12/14 April 1962), also referred to by his initials, MV, was an Indian civil engineer,
 administrator, statesman, who served as the 19th Diwan of Mysore from 1912 to 1918.
<br><br>
Visvesvaraya is regarded in India as one of the foremost civil engineers whose birthday, 15 September, is celebrated every year as Engineer’s Day in India,
 Sri Lanka, and Tanzania. He is also often regarded as “the father of modern Mysore [Kingdom]”.
According to Prajavani, a Kannada language newspaper, he is also the most popular figure in the southern Indian state of Karnataka.
<br><br>
Visvesvaraya worked as a civil engineer for the government of British India and later as Prime Minister of the government of the Kingdom of Mysore. 
For his services to British India, he was appointed CIE and later knighted KCIE. For his services to the Kingdom of Mysore and the Republic of India, 
he was awarded the Bharata Ratna by Government of India in 1955.
		    <br></br>
			M. Visvesvaraya was born on 15 September 1861 at Muddenahalli, Kingdom of Mysore (in present-day Chikkaballapur district, Karnataka) 
in a Telugu Brahmin family to Mokshagundam Srinivasa Shastry and Venkatalakshmi. His ancestors hail from Mokshagundam, a village
 in present-day Andhra Pradesh, and had migrated to the kingdom around three hundred years prior to Visvesvaraya's birth.
<br><br>
Visvesvaraya received his primary education in Bangalore and earned a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree from the University of 
He later studied at the College of Engineering, Pune (then College of Science at the University of Bombay) and graduated as an engineer, 
receiving Diploma in Civil Engineering (DCE). It was here that he became a member of the Deccan Club and was its first secretary; 
he would therefore have been well-acquainted with the progressives in Pune, including Sir R. G. Bhandarkar, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, and 
Justice Mahadev Govind Ranade, who were members of the club.<br><br>

Visvesvaraya became an assistant engineer in 1885 at the Public Works Department, Bombay, in Bombay Presidency.
<br><br>
In 1899, Visvesvaraya was invited to join the Indian Irrigation Commission where he implemented an intricate system of 
irrigation in the Deccan Plateau and designed and patented a system of automatic weir water floodgates that were first installed 
in 1903 at Khadakvasla Dam near Pune. These gates raised the storage level in the reservoir to the highest level likely to be attained 
without causing damage to the dam. Based on the success of these gates, the same system was installed at Tigra Dam in Gwalior and later 
at the KRS Dam near Mysore, Karnataka. He was later the chief engineer of the Laxmi Talav Dam near Kolhapur.
<br><br>
In around 1906/1907, the Government of British India sent Visvesvaraya to the British Colony of Aden (present-day Yemen), to study water 
supply and drainage systems. The project prepared by him was successfully implemented in Aden.
<br><br>
After opting for voluntary retirement in 1908, Visvesvaraya took a foreign tour to study industrialised nations. Then, for a short period, 
he worked for Nizam Mir Osman Ali Khan. He was one of the chief engineers of the flood protection system for the city of Hyderabad when 
suggested flood relief measures for the city, which was under constant threat by the Musi river. He achieved celebrity status when he designed 
a flood protection system for the city. He was instrumental in developing a system to protect Visakhapatnam port from sea erosion. This dam 
created the biggest reservoir in Asia at the time of its construction.
<br><br>
In November 1909, Visvesvaraya was appointed Chief Engineer of Mysore State. He was the chief engineer of the KRS Dam near Mysore. He was also 
later the chairman of the board of engineers for the Tungabhadra Dam in Hospet, Karnataka.<br><br>

In 1912, Visvesvaraya was appointed Diwan of Mysore by Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV. He served for nearly seven years until 1918.
With support from the maharaja, Visvesvaraya contributed to the general development of the Kingdom of Mysore.
<br><br>
During his premiership as Diwan, Visvesvaraya was responsible for the founding of factories and institutions funded for by the maharaja, 
including Mysore Soap Factory, Parasitoid Laboratory, Mysore Iron & Steel Works in Bhadravathi, Bangalore Polytechnic (now Sri Jayachamarajendra 
Polytechnic Bangalore), Bangalore Agricultural University, State Bank of Mysore, Century Club, Mysore Chamber of Commerce (now Federation of Karnataka 
Chambers of Commerce & Industry), Mysore Apex Chamber of Commerce (now Apex Chamber of Karnataka), and numerous other industrial places.The Bangalore Press 
was also established during his tenure as Diwan. He was also instrumental in the founding of Government Engineering College (now University Visvesvaraya College 
of Engineering) at Bangalore in 1917, one of the first engineering institutes in India. He commissioned several new railway lines in Mysore Railways
 (now part of Southwestern Indian Railways).
<br><br>
Visvesvaraya encouraged private investment in industry during his tenure as Diwan. He was instrumental in charting out a plan for road construction between
 Tirumala and Tirupati.
<br><br>
Visvesvaraya gave his technical advice for the location of Mokama Bridge over the Ganga in Bihar. At the time, he was over 90 years ol

<ul>
    <li>
        Sir MV always gave importance to facts and figures and loved statistics.
        When he published a book Reconstructing India in 1920, he mentioned that
         India had 19,410 post offices at that point in time. It is also said he was 
         unmoved by oratorical skills and laid emphasis on facts and facts alone.
    </li>
	<br>
    <li>
        Sir MV was asked to resign as the Dewan of Mysore in 1918 when he openly opposed
         reservation in government services as he was a strong advocate of meritocracy and wanted
          schools be opened for children of backward classes.
 </li>
 <br>
 <li>
    Sir MV had a peculiar habit of using two candles at his home — one for official work and another 
    for personal use.
 </li>
 <br>
 <li>
    Sir Visvesvaraya used to indulge in healthy and constructive debates with the first Prime Minister 
    Jawaharlal Nehru. The engineer felt that the Centre was trampling upon the federal rights. But Nehru
     empowered the capital and did not give much thrust to real autonomy to the states. Sir MV would also
      write many letters to the then Prime Minister.
 </li>
 <br>
 <li>
    Sir MV was never perturbed by the thoughts of death. Nearing his 100th birthday, when he was asked the
     secret behind his longevity, he is reported to have said, “Death called on me long ago but found me not 
     at home and went away.”
 </li>
 <br>
 <li>
    It is said that in his last days, Sir MV had a bank balance of Rs 36,000 after he had distributed money to his
     workers including gardeners and his personal cook. He had a strong notion that his family should stand
      on their own feet.
